		<pre title="welcome text" id="Saina">Saina Nehwal, top seed, suffered a shock second round defeat while Kidambi Srikanth also failed to clear the second round hurdle in men's singles of the $650,000 Super Series Premier event, here on Thursday. (Read more badminton stories here)
Also making an exit was men's doubles pair of Manu Attri and B Sumeeth Reddy.
World number one Saina lost 18-21, 13-21 to world number 18 from Japan Minatsu Mitani in 39 minutes in the women's singles second round.
World No. 5 Srikanth, who had a 1-1 record against Tommy Sugiarto of Indonesia coming into the match, failed to come up with his best game and lost 15-21 17-21 in the men's singles second round.
Top Indian men's doubles pair of Manu and Sumeeth, who reached the finals of Dutch Open last week, put up a brave fight before going down 19-21 22-20 19-21 to eight seeds Lee Sheng Mu and Tsai Chia Hsinof Chinese Taipei.
On Wednesday, H S Prannoy went down fighting against Hsu Jen Hao of Chinese Taipei in the opening round.
World No 16 Prannoy, who had lost to Hao at the 2011 Bulgarian International, could not exert enough pressure on his opponent and suffered a 21-23 21-19 15-21 loss in a men's singles match that lasted an hour and 21 minutes.
Prannoy had dominated most part of the opening game as he led 7-3 early on and even though Hao wrested control for a brief time at 13-12, the Indian grabbed the lead immediately with a four-point burst to move to 17-13 and then held three game points at 20-17.
But Prannoy squandered the lead as Hao surpassed him with four straight points to move to 21-20 and then sealed the game with two more points.
Bolstered by the first game, World No. 24 Hao came into his own in the second and led right from the start to be 15-11 at one stage.
Prannoy, however, had other plans as he caught up with his rival after reeling off four points and after an intense battle managed to pocket the second game with three points straight from 18-19.
In the decider, Prannoy zoomed ahead to a 4-0 lead initially but Hao clawed back at 6-6 and after a battle of supremacy, he broke off from 13-13 to eventually seal the issue in his favour.
In Chinese Taipei Grand Prix tournament, 13th seed Indian Sameer Verma lost to Thailand's Khosit Phetpradab 17-21 23-21 12-21 in men's singles opening round at the Hsing Chuang Gymnasium.</pre>

	<pre title="welcome text" id="Zaheer">Dressed in a dapper sapphire blue bandhgala and jeans, fast bowler Zaheer Khan posed before photographers as flash bulbs lit his beaming face. It was a big day and he basked in the glory of his 15-year-old international cricketing career that's now come to an end. (Zaheer Khan Calls Time On His International Career)
"I am feeling nostalgic. There are so many memories. It was around my birthday (October 7) that I told my ammi and abba that I was retiring. Then I spoke to Sachin (Tendulkar), Yuvi (Yuvraj Singh) and few other friends. It's difficult to say how one arrives at it and it's a tough call but I just knew the time was right," the world's fourth-most successful left-handed pacer told NDTV. (Zaheer Khan, A Thinking Bowler Lauds Sachin Tendulkar and MS Dhoni)
Zaheer, who has interest in food and beverage sector and has a hotel in Pune named after him, has ruled out any role in politics and is open to becoming the bowling coach of the national side. ""I am open to it. I have already been advising the boys, so yes, I am open," he stated. (Lifting World Cup Greatest Moment of My Life)
One of the most handsome, well-dressed cricketers, Zaheer, who has been linked with Bollywood star Isha Sharvani in the past, has ruled out marriage. The 37-year-old former speedster said, ""I have not really thought about it (marriage or politics)," he laughed, cheekily adding, "Right now, I am dealing with only one thing at a time. Maybe, meet me a few months later and you could hear more!"
Regarded as a "thinking bowler" by greats like Sachin Tendulkar and Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Zaheer - who is now India's second highest wicket-taker - said that fast bowler Umesh Yadav had the potential. "He has a very bright future. He just has to have the confidence and get things going for himself." </pre>

	<pre title="welcome text" id="Sourav">Kolkata: Former India skipper Sourav Ganguly on Thursday officially took over as president of the cash-rich Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) and promised to revamp the iconic Eden Gardens ground in three months. (King Pele Mesemerises Prince of Kolkata, Sourav Ganguly)
Addressing the media, minutes after his unanimous election to the top post at a Special General Meeting (SGM), Ganguly declared his focus would be on maintaining transparency in his actions.
Hew also said there were plans to hold new tournaments and revitalise junior cricket.
"In the last 20 years I have travelled over the world and I know what kind of infrastructure is there in world class stadiums. I can guarantee you in the next 3 months Eden Gardens will have such infrastructure," he said.
"We are already making an effort and the BCCI curator will fly in here in some time," said Ganguly, who replaced cricket czar Jagmohan Dalmiya, who died on September 20.
Completing the change of guard, Dalmiya's son Avishek was also elected unopposed as joint-secretary, a post held by Ganguly from July last year till recently before he resigned ahead of the SGM.
"Since there were no other nominations, their unanimous election was announced on the floor of the SGM, that got over in ten minutes," said a CAB member present at the meeting.
Terming Avishek as the vice captain, Ganguly said his focus now will be to inject transparency within the association.
"We need to work as a team to make it transparent. I already had targets as a secretary, we have already thought of new tournaments and now we have to execute our plans well."
Speaking about his feelings after taking over as the state cricket association president, Ganguly termed it a "new challenge".
"It helps you when you have knowledge of the game, and me having had the little experience in administration will help me. Avishek has got to learn as well and our entire focus will be on the 22 yards and providing the best possible facilities."
Describing Jagmohan Dalmiya as a father figure, Ganguly said he would try to take his work forward.
"As an administrator I have only seen Jagmohan Dalmiya closely. He was a father figure. It is a proud moment for me but I did not want to take this job up under such circumstances (referring to the passing away of Dalmiya). We will try and take his work forward."
Ganguly said his team would also focus on making the Twenty20 world Cup final to be held at the Eden Gardens on April 3 next year a success.
He said the CAB needed remodelling.
"Every infrastructure needs remodelling. Even your offices. The CAB is no exception."
Comparing his CAB presidency with captaining a team, he said: "Back then I used to lead a squad of 15, now I have to deal with 121 (affiliated units)."
Ganguly also said CAB has plans to revitalise junior cricket where young kids will be groomed from the age of 8-9 so that they turn world beaters by 15.
"We have revitalised all cricket. Next up will be the juniors who will be groomed from the age of 8-9 so that by 15 they can turn world beaters. CAB has both the money and the infrastructure to do that."</pre>
